Implementation of Linear Regression with Gradient Optimization in NumPy

This project implements linear regression from scratch using the NumPy library in Python. The goal is to find the best model parameters by minimizing the MSE (Mean Squared Error) cost function using gradient descent
and to visualize the learning process to observe how model parameters change and how the cost function decreases over iterations.
